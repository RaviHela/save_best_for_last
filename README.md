Analyzing if there is any relationship between average fees collected from a student and his day of admission.
# Motivation
It is frequently observed that there is a surge of admissions during monthend day in JG courses. There is a race at month end to come at the top of the stack by showing most admissions. Other infuencer is pressure from Sales team at Head Office to bring admission. There is a concern that such factors possibly lead to compromises on quality of student. In this context we define quality of student as his disposition to pay his full fees. In our data set this is captured by feature AR% which we will refer to as Average Realisation. This AR% is a preprocessed variable inthiis dataset which is the ratio of collection over the booking value.

# Research Question:
 Do monthend admissions tend to have lower average realisation
